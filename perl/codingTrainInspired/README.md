This folder will contain various programs inspired by Coding Train videos

The QuadTree (see up one directory) should really be included, but I worked on it
before I decided on this separate directory, but couldn't be bothered to move it. ;-)

The equivalent of `sketch.js` will be a reasonably-named `ProjectName.pl`.  Any extra
modules will go in the `lib` directory, though if a package/class is small enough,
I'll probably just keep it in the sketch instead.  Each project might also have a
`ProjectName.README.md`, or I might just keep the notes in the `__END__` or
POD `=begin README` sections

I actually didn't get far before I started transitioning to an encapsulating library,
because I already saw how horrible it was going to be if I didn't automate each frame
being generated by the draw-loop.

## GD Notes:

I found that even though I have strawberry 5.38, with libgd 2.3.2, GD.pm was claiming I needed
at least 2.0.33, which I obviously have.

    - https://metacpan.org/dist/GD/source/GD.xs#L1028 says I need HAVE_GIFANIM defined
    - https://metacpan.org/dist/GD/source/Makefile.PL#L75 shows how I add it during Makefile.PL run
    - how do I know which options I currently have?

        DESCRIPTION
            Supported Image formats:

            PNG             GIF             JPEG             Tiff             WBMP             WEBP             Avif             BMP

            Unsupported Image formats:

            Gd             Gd2             Xpm             GIFANIM             Heif
    - So I want
        --options       "JPEG,PNG,WEBP,GIF,GIFANIM,WBMP,BMP,AVIF,TIFF"
    - don't know if I'll need other options or not
        - _probably_ will need to know the paths to each of those libraries
    -   TODO:
        cpanm --look GD
        perl Makefile.PL --options       "JPEG,PNG,WEBP,GIF,GIFANIM,BMP,AVIF,TIFF"
                /usr/local/apps/berrybrew/perls/system/c/lib
