This folder will contain various programs inspired by Coding Train videos

The QuadTree (see up one directory) should really be included, but I worked on it
before I decided on this separate directory, but couldn't be bothered to move it. ;-)

The equivalent of `sketch.js` will be a reasonably-named `ProjectName.pl`.  Any extra
modules will go in the `lib` directory, though if a package/class is small enough,
I'll probably just keep it in the sketch instead.  Each project might also have a
`ProjectName.README.md`, or I might just keep the notes in the `__END__` or
POD `=begin README` sections

I actually didn't get far before I started transitioning to an encapsulating library,
because I already saw how horrible it was going to be if I didn't automate each frame
being generated by the draw-loop.
